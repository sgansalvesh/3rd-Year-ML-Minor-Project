This is my ML minor project that I did in my 3rd academic year with my other two members under the guidance of Mr.Rakesh Kumar Rai

This project explores emotion recognition from EEG signals by comparing deep learning (GRU) with traditional ML models. EEG features were extracted using PyWavelets and analyzed using various classifiers. Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy (96.09%), outperforming SVM, Decision Tree, and GRU (86.88%). The results highlight the effectiveness of traditional ML approaches for EEG-based emotion detection.
